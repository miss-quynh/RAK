# RAK

Random acts of Kindness (RAK) is a mobile-first web application where trusted organisations and charities can create wish lists of items for prospective donors. Each year charities receive donations that do not meet their specific needs or campaign goals, resulting in millions of dollars&#39; worth of goods going to waste each year. Fundamentally, RAK&#39;s goal is to streamline the process of donating goods whilst minimising waste.
